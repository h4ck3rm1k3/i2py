INTRODUCTION
------------
i2py provides tools for converting programs and scripts written in Research
System Inc.'s IDL programming language to Python.  It is not an IDL-compatible
front end for the Python interpreter, nor does it make any attempt to replicate
the functionality of the IDL standard library.  Rather, its only purpose is to
perform source-to-source conversion of legacy IDL code to Python.  Currently,
it supports only procedural IDL, although support for object-oriented code may
be added in the future.

i2py is free software, distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License.  See the file COPYING for details.

------
STATUS
------
This is an alpha release of i2py.  Although the code is functional, not all IDL
language constructs can be converted yet, many parts of the code need review
and revision, and the entire package needs extensive testing before it will be
ready for production use.

That said, if you're willing to try it out, any feedback (comments, bug
reports, patches) will be greatly appreciated.  Please e-mail it to
Chris Stawarz <chris@pseudogreen.org>.
